DDD Annotations -- Spring Integration
====================================

This project aims at simplifying the development of [Domain Driven Design](https://www.domainlanguage.com/) applications
with the [Spring Framework](https://spring.io/projects/spring-framework).

It provides configurations annotations which automatically scan the application for classes with *DDD annotations* and
registers them as beans.
